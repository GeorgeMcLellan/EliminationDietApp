# SCD Food List Android App

An Android app to help people on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) check if a food is allowed or not on the diet. This app is endorsed by Kirkton Press Limited, owner of the SCD trademark.

## Download

This app is available for download on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.development.georgemcl.eliminationdietapp&hl=en).

## Why I Made It

The SCD diet is followed by thousands of people worldwide, helping them in managing and overcoming chronic illness and digestive issues. It is a very specific diet (hence the name) and can be challenging to follow without the right tools. I developed this app because being able to easily look up a particular food on the go to see if its legal or illegal on the diet is of tremendous help.

With the help of the publishers of the book and creators of the diet, I worked to ensure the content in the app is fully accurate & consistent. As a result, I was given approval to use the SCD trademark.

The app continues to get consistent downloads every day on Google Play and is close to 1000 total.

## Technologies Used

Being a very simple app, there isn't a need for architectural patterns like MVVM or MVP, nor dependency injection or reactive programming libraries.

It uses data binding to easily display data in the view and reduce boilerplate in the Activity and Recycler View Adapter files, keeping them small and easily maintainable.
